Features:
---------
Simple calcultor that adds, subtracts, multiplies, and divides in Python. It is able to use these functions on decimals, hexadecimals, and octals. Does this by parsing input string and returning a tuple which consists of two operands and an operator. Parses type based off of input and performs operation then prints.
